Karaoke Mode for YouTube™ attempts to remove the vocals from the video.

Simply click the Karaoke button that appears in the YouTube player, as illustrated with a microphone.

If they can be found, lyrics will be displayed on the side.

Videos that are forced to play in Flash, such as VEVO, will not work with the plugin.  
This technique does not work with some songs.
