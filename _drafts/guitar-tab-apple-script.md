## iTunes Guitar Tab Apple Script
If you don't run Mac OS X 10.9+ (Mavericks), you can get the tab for the current iTunes song with the script below. Simply download the script, unzip it, and place it into the following path (where "~" is your username):
<pre>Users/~/Library/iTunes/Scripts</pre>
If the scripts folder doesn't exist, you can create it yourself.
Then from iTunes click on the script icon, and then "Guitar Tab Search". Then a new web page will appear with a search from 911Tabs.
