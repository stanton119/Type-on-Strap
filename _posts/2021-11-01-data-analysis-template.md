After experimenting with various project structures I've decided to start building my own:

This comes from multiple projects with other frameworks such as [Cookie Cutter Data Science](https://github.com/drivendata/cookiecutter-data-science/) and [Kedro](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro).

It uses the parts of both which I like and adding in some other parts that I thought were missing.

Things it includes so far:

*   fsspec for IO
*   config.yml for parameters
*   testing - pytest
*   docs - mkdocs
*   pre-commit code formatting


I intend to update this when I see necessary so it should hopefully remain fluid.
